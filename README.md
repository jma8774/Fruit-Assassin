Because I have a problem commiting Java files onto GitHub, this repository does not contain the whole project. However you can download it from the [zip file](https://github.com/jma8774/Fruit-Assassin/blob/master/Fruit-Assassin.zip) here, pull project and move file from app\src\main\java zip to the pulled.
